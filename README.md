## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sari-Amin/solar-challenge-week1.git
cd solar-challenge-week1
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Or using `conda`:

```bash
conda create -n solar-env python=3.10
conda activate solar-env
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Optional: Run the Streamlit App

To launch the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Ensure these files exist in the [`data/`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sariamin/week1-data) directory:

```
data/
├── benin_clean.csv
├── togo_clean.csv
└── sierra_leone_clean.csv
```

These CSVs are generated by running the EDA notebooks in `notebooks/`.
